# Trial-and-Error

## Learning in Computing

Trial-and-error is important to software design and development. It describes
an iterative (i.e., repetitive) process of trying something out, seeing how it
works, identifying errors or “bugs”, and addressing those errors before trying
again… and again, and again, until you get an outcome you like or want.

Unlike many tests in schools, in computer science making errors are good
things that we learn from. As computer scientist and educational activist
Seymour Papert (1980) explained, “Errors benefit us because they lead us to
study what happened, to understand what went wrong, and, through
understanding, to fix it" (pp. 126-127).

Sometimes mistakes and errors lead to unexpected and interesting results that
you might want to keep. We can think about trial-and-error as a type of
collaboration with a computer, where you both are working together to make
unique contributions to the final result.

## Learning in Barbering

Trial-and-error is also important for barbers. Like in computing, learning
from mistakes is an important way for barbers to grow and develop their
skills.

A barbering instructor put it this way: “The trial-and-error part comes in
seeing your flaws and learning to fix them on the next go around because
you're gonna actually make mistakes. Even a professional, sometimes, you make
mistakes, but you've got to be able to correct those mistakes and learn from
the things that you do as time [goes] on.”

But, unlike computing, learning from trial-and-error happens on a longer time
scale with barbering, since hair takes time to grow back.

## Learning with Barbershop Computing

With the Barbershop Computing program, you can bring trial-and-error learning
from computing and trial-and-error learning from barbering together. You can
try out different designs in the program, creating multiple iterations by
creatively collaborating with the computer, before attempting a design on a
hair mannequin, a classmate, or yourself in your barbering classroom.
